The purpose of this project is to demonsatrate core data analytics skills, including data sourcing, exploratory analysis, visualisation, and basic statistical modelling, using Python-based tools.

## Contents
- problems.ipynb - Main anlysis notebook containing solutions and explanations
- requirements.txt - Pyhton dependancies required to run the project.
- data/ - Directory for datasets used in analysis.
- img/ - Directory for generated plots or images,where applicable.

## Set up
To run project locally:

1. Clone repository:
git clone https://github.com/aiswarialajan124-png/principles_of_data_analytics.git

2. Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open analysis notebook:
jupyter notebook problems.ipynb

## Data
The analysis uses the Palmer Penguins dataset,it is publicly available commonly used for data analysis and visualisation.

Where possible,data is loaded directly form a public source within the code to avoid manual setup steps and to ensure reproductability.
Any externally sourced data files are stored in the 'data/' directory.
